You will be given a table and a system-generated description for that table.

Your task is to evaluate how well each sentence in the system-generated description matches the information presented in the table.

Please read and understand these instructions carefully. Refer to this document while reviewing as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

- **Entailed**: A generated statement that is entailed by the corresponding gold description, i.e., is equivalent to one of the extracted statements from the gold description.
- **Extra**: A generated statement that is not entailed by the gold description but is factually correct based on the table content.
- **Incorrect**: A generated statement that is related to the table but is factually incorrect.
- **Hallucinated**: A generated statement that is irrelevant to the table.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the gold description and the table to understand their content.
2. Split the system-generated description into individual sentences.
3. Compare each sentence in the system-generated description to the gold description and the table.
4. Classify each sentence into one of the following categories: Entailed, Extra, Incorrect, or Hallucinated.
