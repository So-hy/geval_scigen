You will be given a system-generated description and a table. Your task is to evaluate the system-generated description based on four categories: Entailed, Extra, Incorrect, and Hallucinated. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Entailed: A statement in the system-generated description is entailed by the gold description. In other words, it is equivalent to a statement in the gold description.

Extra: A statement in the system-generated description is not entailed by the gold description but is correct based on the table's content.

Incorrect: A statement in the system-generated description is related to the table but is factually incorrect.

Hallucinated: A statement in the system-generated description is unrelated to the table's content.


Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the table carefully and identify the key information.
2. Read the system-generated description and compare it to the table.
3. For each statement in the system-generated description:
Check if the statement is entailed by the gold description.
If not entailed, check if the statement is correct based on the table (Extra).
Mark any statement that is related to the table but factually incorrect (Incorrect).
Mark any statement that is irrelevant to the table (Hallucinated).
4. Assign the appropriate label (Entailed, Extra, Incorrect, Hallucinated) to each statement in the system-generated description.
