You will be given a table description and a system-generated description for the same table.

First, split both the gold description and the generated description into individual sentences.

Then, for each generated sentence, classify it into one of the following four categories:

- **Entailed**: The generated sentence is equivalent to one of the sentences in the gold description.
- **Extra**: The generated sentence is not present in the gold description but is factually correct based on the table's content.
- **Incorrect**: The generated sentence is related to the table but factually incorrect.
- **Hallucinated**: The generated sentence is unrelated to the table.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Split the gold description and the generated description into sentences.
2. Compare each generated sentence with the gold description sentences.
3. Classify each generated sentence into one of the categories: Entailed, Extra, Incorrect, or Hallucinated.
4. Return the classification for each sentence in the generated description, **only the classification label**.

Example:

Gold Description:

{{GoldDescription}}

Generated Description:
