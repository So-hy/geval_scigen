You will be given a table and a system-generated description for that table.

Your task is to evaluate how well each sentence in the system-generated description matches the information presented in the table.

Please read and understand these instructions carefully. Refer to this document while reviewing as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

- **Entailed**: The generated sentence is factually correct based on the table's content.
- **Extra**: The generated sentence is factually correct but introduces additional information not present in the table.
- **Incorrect**: The generated sentence is related to the table but factually incorrect.
- **Hallucinated**: The generated sentence is unrelated to the table's content.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the table and understand its content.
2. Split the system-generated description into individual sentences.
3. Compare each sentence in the system-generated description to the content of the table.
4. Classify each sentence into one of the following categories: Entailed, Extra, Incorrect, or Hallucinated.
